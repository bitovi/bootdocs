 /**
* @styles contextual-colors Contextual Colors
* @parent helper-classes.less 0
*
* @description
* Convey meaning through color with a handful of emphasis utility classes. These may also be applied to links 
* and will darken on hover just like our default link styles.
*
* @demo demos/helper-classes/contextual-colors/demo.html
*
* <blockquote>
* <h4>Dealing with specificity</h4>
* Sometimes emphasis classes cannot be applied due to the specificity of another selector. In most cases, a 
* sufficient workaround is to wrap your text in a <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> with the class.
* </blockquote>
*
* <blockquote>
* <h4>Conveying meaning to assistive technologies</h4>
* Using color to add meaning only provides a visual indication, which will not be conveyed to users of assistive 
* technologies – such as screen readers. Ensure that information denoted by the color is either obvious from the 
* content itself (the contextual colors are only used to reinforce meaning that is already present in the text/markup), 
* or is included through alternative means, such as additional text hidden with the <code>.sr-only</code> class.

* Similar to the contextual text color classes, easily set the background of an element to any contextual class.

* <blockquote>
* <h4>Dealing with specificity</h4>
* Sometimes contextual background classes cannot be applied due to the specificity of another selector. In some cases,

*
* <blockquote>
* <h4>Conveying meaning to assistive technologies</h4>
* As with <a href="/contextual-colors.html">contextual colors</a>, ensure that any meaning conveyed through color is also conveyed in a format that is not 
* purely presentational.

/**
* @styles showing-and-hiding-content Showing and hiding content
* @parent helper-classes.less 7
*
* @description
* Force an element to be shown or hidden (including for screen readers) with the use of `.show` and `.hidden` classes. 
* These classes use `!important` to avoid specificity conflicts, just like the [quick floats](\quick-floats). They are only available 
* for block level toggling. They can also be used as mixins.
*
*`.hide` is available, but it does not always affect screen readers and is deprecated as of v3.0.1. Use `.hidden` or 
*`.sr-only` instead.
*
* Furthermore, `.invisible` can be used to toggle only the visibility of an element, meaning its `display` is not 
* modified and the element can still affect the flow of the document.
*
```
<div class="show">...</div>
<div class="hidden">...</div>
```
*
```
// Classes
.show {
  display: block !important;
}
.hidden {
  display: none !important;
}
.invisible {
  visibility: hidden;
}

// Usage as mixins
.element {
  .show();
}
.another-element {
  .hidden();
