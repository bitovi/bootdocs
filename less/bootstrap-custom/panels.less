  *
  * While not always necessary, sometimes you need to put your DOM in a box. For those situations, try the panel component.
  *
  * ## Basic example
  * By default, all the `.panel` does is apply some basic border and padding to contain some content.
  *
  * ```
  * <div class="panel panel-default">
  *   <div class="panel-body">
  *      Basic panel example
  *   </div>
  * </div>
  * ```
  *
  * @demo demos/panels/demo.html
  *
  * ## Panel with heading
  * Easily add a heading container to your panel with `.panel-heading`. You may also include any `<h1>`-`<h6>` with a `.panel-title` class to add a pre-styled heading.
  * 
  * For proper link coloring, be sure to place links in headings within `.panel-title`.
  *

  *
  * ## Panel with footer
  * Wrap buttons or secondary text in `.panel-footer`. Note that panel footers do not inherit colors and borders when using contextual variations as they are not meant to be in the foreground.
  * 
  * @demo demos/panels-footer/demo.html
  *
  * ## Contextual alternatives
  * Like other components, easily make a panel more meaningful to a particular context by adding any of the contextual state classes.

  *
  * ## With tables
  * Add any non-bordered `.table` within a panel for a seamless design. If there is a `.panel-body`, we add an extra border to the top of the table for separation.
  * 
  * @demo demos/panels-tables/demo1.html
  *
  * If there is no panel body, the component moves from panel header to table without interruption.
  *

  *
  * ## With list groups
  * Easily include full-width list groups within any panel.
