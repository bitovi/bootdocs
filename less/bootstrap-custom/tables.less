  * @stylesheet tables.less Tables
  * @parent css 21
  *
  * ## Basic example
  *
  * For basic styling - light padding and only horizontal dividers - add the base class `.table` to any `<table>`. It may seem super redundant, but given the widespread use of tables for other plugins like calendars and date pickers, we've opted to isolate our custom table styles.
  * ```
  * <table class="table">...</table>
  * ```
  *
  * @demo demos/tables/demo.html
  *
  * ## Striped rows
  * Use `.table-striped` to add zebra-striping to any table row within the `<tbody>`.
  *
  * ### Cross-browser compatibility
  * Striped tables are styled via the `:nth-child` CSS selector, which is not available in Internet Explorer 8.

  *
  * ## Bordered table
  * Add `.table-bordered` for borders on all sides of the table and cells.
  * 
  * @demo demos/tables-bordered/demo.html
  *
  * ## Hover rows
  * Add `.table-hover` to enable a hover state on table rows within a `<tbody>`.
  * 
  * @demo demos/tables-hover/demo.html
  *
  * ## Condensed table
  * Add `.table-condensed` to make tables more compact by cutting cell padding in half.

  *
  * ## Contextual classes
  * Use contextual classes to color table rows or individual cells.

  * ### Conveying meaning to assistive technologies
  * Using color to add meaning to a table row or individual cell only provides a visual indication, which will not be conveyed to users of assistive technologies - such as screen readers. Ensure that information denoted by the color is either obvious from the content itself (the visible text in the relevant table row/cell), or is included through alternative means, such as additional text hidden with the `.sr-only` class.
  * 
  * ## Responsive tables
  * Create responsive tables by wrapping any `.table` in `.table-responsive` to make them scroll horizontally on small devices (under 768px). When viewing on anything larger than 768px wide, you will not see any difference in these tables.
  *
  * ### Vertical clipping/truncation
  * Responsive tables make use of `overflow-y: hidden`, which clips off any content that goes beyond the bottom or top edges of the table. In particular, this can clip off dropdown menus and other third-party widgets.
  * 
  * ### Firefox and fieldsets
  * Firefox has some awkward fieldset styling involving `width` that interferes with the responsive table. This cannot be overriden without a Firefox-specific hack that we don't provide in Bootstrap:
  * ```
  * @-moz-document url-prefix() {
  *  fieldset { display: table-cell; }
  * }
  * ```
